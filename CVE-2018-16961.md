# CVE-2018-16961

**Vendor:** Center for Computational Research, University at Buffalo

**Product:** Open XDMoD

**Affected versions:** < 8.0

Open XDMoD is an open source tool to facilitate the management of high performance computing resources. It is widely deployed at academic, industrial, and government HPC centres. The web interface is written in PHP. The vulnerabilities discussed in this report have been discovered in version 7.5, and will be addressed in the upcoming 8.0 release.

## Directory Traversal

This vulnerability relates to a directory traversal opportunity in "html/gui/general/dl_publication.php". Although an attacker can request a file download using a crafted "file" parameter argument, NULL byte injection is handled by recent versions of PHP which substantially reduces the impact. However, it is still possible to request arbitrary files ending in ".PDF".
